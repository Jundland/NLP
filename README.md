### nlp03_sentiment.py
- 3.1 TextBlob
   - Outputs Polarity and Subjectivity
   - Polarity is a float between [-1, 1].  -1 indicates negative sentiment, and +1 indicates positive sentiment
   - Subjectivity is a float between [0, 1], relating to the level of personal opinion, emotion or judgment in the text
- 3.2 VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)
   - Outputs pos, neu, neg which is proportion of text attributed to positive, neutral or negative sentiment
   - Also outputs compound in the range [-1, 1], which is the normalized score of all lexicon ratings

##### Notes on TextBlob and VADER sentiment
##### - TextBlob may be preferred for formal text, and VADER for more informal text or social media
##### - neither TextBlob or VADER differentiate based on upper/lower casing of text
##### - TextBlob will differentiate sentiment based on punctuation (e.g. !) but not for repeated punctuation (e.g. !!!)
##### - VADER will also differentiate sentiment based on repeated punctuation (e.g. ! vs !!!)
